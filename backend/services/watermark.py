"""
Invisible + visible audio watermarking for Sesly.

Two layers:
  1. **Invisible** — AudioSeal (Meta) embeds imperceptible neural watermarks
     that survive compression, resampling, and editing. Encodes a 16-bit
     message identifying Sesly as the source.
  2. **Visible** — Optional audio signature tone prepended to exports;
     ffmpeg-based logo overlay for video exports.

Usage:
    from services.watermark import embed_watermark, detect_watermark

    # Embed (returns same shape tensor, watermarked)
    watermarked = embed_watermark(waveform, sample_rate)

    # Detect (returns dict with confidence + metadata)
    result = detect_watermark(waveform, sample_rate)

    EU AI Act Art. 50(2) — applicable 2026-08-02, expressly carved out of the
    open-source exemption (Art. 2(12)) — requires synthetic audio to carry a
    machine-readable mark; the invisible AudioSeal watermark is that mark.

    and ``tests/test_watermark_route_coverage.py`` structurally asserts every
    synthesis call site references it — a new audio route can't silently ship
    without provenance marking again.
