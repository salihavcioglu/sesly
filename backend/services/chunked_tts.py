"""Chunked TTS generation utilities (Wave 1.2 — unlimited-length generation).

Adapted from voicebox (https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox), MIT License,
Copyright (c) voicebox contributors. The concatenation half is reworked for
torch tensors (our inference helpers pass raw model output — possibly
multi-channel — to the effect chain), and the sample rate comes from the
engine's declared rate rather than the first chunk (fixes a latent upstream
bug where a mid-run rate change was silently ignored).

Splits long text into sentence-boundary chunks and joins the per-chunk audio
with a short crossfade. Pure functions — the generation loop itself lives in
``api/routers/generation.py`` next to the existing ``[pause]`` span stitcher,
so this module stays unit-testable without a model.

Short text (<= max_chunk_chars) never reaches this module's concat path; the
callers keep their unchanged single-shot fast path.

    plus ``' ...'`` splits into ``['aaa…', '...']``.

    Sending that to an engine is at best a wasted GPU job, and at worst the
    engine returns no audio for it — which is indistinguishable from the
    silent-truncation bug this module now reports out loud. Users would get
    "part of your text produced no audio — '...'" for a chunk that never
    carried any speech, which teaches them to ignore a warning that exists to
    catch real data loss.

    The punctuation is not dropped: it is appended to the previous chunk (or
    prepended to the next, when it comes first), so the text the engine sees is
    unchanged in content and the join still covers every character.

    ``max_chars`` keeps that fold honest. Appending blindly would push the

    tests assert (review). When the fold would overflow, the last WORD of
    the previous chunk moves across instead, so the fragment carries speech of
    its own and both chunks stay inside the limit.

    That is not always possible: the neighbour may be a single word, or its
    last word may itself be punctuation (borrowing it would just produce a
    second silent chunk — measured: ``"longer." + "." -> ". ."``). In those
    cases the fold wins and the chunk runs over, but **only ever by non-speech
    characters** — measured worst case, 3. ``max_chars`` bounds how much SPEECH
    a chunk holds (#505, the acoustic-degradation limit), and trailing
