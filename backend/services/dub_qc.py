"""Second-pass ASR quality control for dubs (Wave 3.3 / Spec 5).

After a dub is generated, re-recognize the synthetic audio and compare what
the ASR *heard* against what we asked the TTS to *say*. Where the two drift
apart, the line is flagged for the user to verify — turning subtitle timing
and pronunciation from "trusted math" into "measured truth", and doubling as
an automatic dub-quality check.

Design delta from pyvideotrans (whose second pass lets recognized text
*replace* the subtitles wholesale): we keep the GENERATED text authoritative
for content and use the second pass for *measurement* — timing + a drift
score that feeds the incremental re-dub loop, never silently overwriting the
translation.

Pure functions here (no ASR, no I/O) so the scoring is unit-testable; the
pipeline stage that runs the ASR pass lives in the dub router.
