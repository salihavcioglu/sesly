"""Pre-rendered voice previews — the download client for the voice gallery.

A fresh install can hear nothing until the 2.4 GB TTS checkpoint lands
(``config/models.yaml``), because every archetype preview is synthesized on
demand on the GPU. This module fetches previews that were rendered once, ahead
of time, by ``scripts/render_gallery.py`` and published as a release of the
``omnivoice-gallery`` repo, so the voice picker works on first run and stops
burning a cold model load per voice afterwards.

Trust
=====
``manifest.json`` is signed with the **existing Tauri release key** and verified
against :data:`UPDATER_PUBKEY` — the same public key the updater already carries
in ``frontend/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json``, kept in lockstep by
``tests/test_gallery_previews.py``. Signature verification is the *only* thing
that makes the per-file SHA-256 digests meaningful, so a manifest that fails it
is discarded outright (including a manifest already on disk: it is re-verified
on every load, not trusted because it was trusted once). No new key, no new
infrastructure, no second trust root.

Consent — the gallery is OPT-IN
===============================
Downloading previews is a new outbound call, and Sesly's local-first
guarantee is that nothing leaves the machine without an explicit yes. "It fails
silently offline and can be turned off" is not consent, so there is **no
on-install background fetch**: :func:`is_enabled` is false until the user turns
the gallery on in Settings, and every network entry point in this module is a
no-op while it is off. Turning it on is the yes, and it is what schedules the
featured-set download. With the gallery off — or unreachable — previews render
locally exactly as they always have, which is the whole app remaining functional
with everything declined.

Fixed reference renderings
==========================
The preview key is ``sha256(instruct|language)[:16]`` (``archetypes.py``), which
is derived from the archetype *definition* and says nothing about which engine
produced the audio. Gallery files are therefore a **fixed reference rendering**
of each voice — the engine that rendered them is recorded in the manifest
(``engine`` / ``engine_version``) and surfaced in Settings, not encoded in the
key. Because of that they live in their own directory and never mix with the
user's local renders under ``OUTPUTS_DIR/archetype_previews``, which share the
same key and follow whichever engine is active. On collision the gallery wins:
it is the rendering we can prove the provenance of.

They are also, deliberately, never reference audio. ``/archetypes/{id}/use``
renders locally, always — a downloaded MP3 must not become the sample a user's
cloned voice is built from.
