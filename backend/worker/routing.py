"""Where work runs: this machine, or one node the user picked.

The scheduler underneath can rank many workers, and the hosted platform will
need that. The OSS product deliberately does not expose it. Here the user
chooses a single target from a list — ``Local``, or one of the machines they
enrolled — and that choice is the whole policy:

    GPU: [ Local ▾ ]        Local
                            desktop-4090    192.168.0.222:2222
                            laptop-m2       192.168.0.31:7443

Two reasons this beats automatic selection for a desktop app. It is
predictable — a user who sends a job to their 4090 can see that is where it
went, rather than discovering the scheduler preferred a laptop. And it is
explainable when it goes wrong: "your chosen worker is offline, this ran
locally" is a sentence; "least-busy ranking picked another node" is not.

Exactly one target is active at a time. Other enrolled workers may be
connected — they simply receive nothing, which is what standby means.

Fallback is not one rule but three, because "it ran locally instead" is a
kindness in the first case and a lie in the others:

  1. **Before dispatch** — the chosen worker is offline, disabled, paused, or
     gone — the work runs here, quietly, with the named reason this module
     produces. A user who picks their desktop and then walks over to switch it
     on should get their audio, not an error about infrastructure.
  2. **Mid-job, single-shot interactive work** raises instead. Silently
     redoing minutes of remote work on the wrong machine is not a fallback;
     the error carries a "run locally instead" that resubmits.
  3. **Multi-unit jobs** (audiobook chapters, batches) fall back per unit
     after N consecutive remote failures, with one aggregated notice — a 4090
     that goes to sleep at chapter 40 must not turn a working book into 160
     identical error rows.

Only rule 1 lives here; rules 2 and 3 belong to the job surfaces that own the
work, because only they know whether a unit has already started.

Targeting is also per operation. The scheduler will place anything a worker
advertises, but a job only reaches the scheduler where this side has a
producer for it — so ``decide(op=...)`` answers for the surface the user is
looking at rather than for the machine, and the badge cannot read
"gpu2 ● ready" on a tab whose work is 100% local.

Speech synthesis, chapter-at-a-time audiobook and Stories rendering, and
coarse ``dub_segments`` synthesis have remote producers. Dub assembly, ASR,
diarization, translation and RVC remain local. Dictation is
intentionally local regardless of the selected target because its latency is
the feature.
