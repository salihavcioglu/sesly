"""Lifecycle for the remote-worker feature, on both sides.

One module owns starting and stopping everything, because the feature has to be
genuinely absent when it is switched off. The local-first guarantee is not
"we do not use the network much" — it is that a user who never enables this
has no listening socket, no certificate, no background loop, and an app that
behaves exactly as it did before.

So nothing here runs unless ``remote_workers_enabled()`` is true, and the gRPC
imports happen inside the start path rather than at module import.
