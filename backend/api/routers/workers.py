"""Remote worker management API.

Deliberately small. The council's warning about the original design was that
seven strategies times three execution modes times priorities times weights
times per-model concurrency is a configuration surface nobody can test and
every knob is a compatibility promise forever. So this exposes what a user
actually needs to run their other GPU: see workers, add one, name it, prefer
one, pause one, remove one.

Two things here are not conveniences and must not be softened:

  * **Consent is explicit and per worker.** Audio, reference voices, and text
    leave the machine for a worker, so each one is approved individually. There
    is no global "trust all workers".
  * **A token is shown exactly once.** Only its hash is stored, so it cannot be
    re-displayed — which is the point.

One endpoint here is not part of that surface: `POST /workers/tasks` submits a
single task and waits for it, and exists only because the scheduler otherwise
has no caller at all outside the tests. It is marked dev-only everywhere it
appears and is replaced by the GPU gateway.
