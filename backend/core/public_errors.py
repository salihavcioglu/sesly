# clock starts (#1033). That warm-up translated only a TIMEOUT into an
# actionable reply. A download that FAILED — the mirror unreachable, DNS gone,
# the connection refused, the body truncated, the cache corrupt — escaped the
# route and reached the global 500 handler, which could only say "Sesly
# hit an internal error": it named neither the engine nor the fact that a model
# download was the thing that broke. #2298 is that report (KittenTTS, first
# generate, an unreachable mirror). A download that stalls and a download that
# fails are the same event to the user, so they now get the same treatment.
