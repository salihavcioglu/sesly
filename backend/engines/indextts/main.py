"""IndexTTS 2.5/2 sidecar entry point (Phase 2 Plan 02-03).

Runs inside ``engines/indextts/.venv`` (or the user's existing
``${OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR}/.venv``) with ``transformers<5``, isolated
from the Sesly parent process which pins ``transformers>=5.3``.
Closes issue #42 — the canonical ``OffloadedCache`` ImportError that
results from running both libraries inside one Python interpreter.

This script is stdlib-only at import time. It imports the indextts
library lazily on the first synthesize op so the sidecar can emit a
``ready`` frame within the parent's 30 s spawn handshake even when the
model itself takes ~20 s cold-load (RESEARCH.md Pitfall 8). Any import
failure surfaces as an ``error`` frame with full traceback before the
sidecar exits 1 — the parent's stderr drain + the operator's logs will
also have the underlying ImportError text.

Wire protocol — length-prefixed JSON over stdin/stdout, byte-identical
to ``backend/services/subprocess_backend.py``::

    [ 4-byte big-endian uint32 length ][ N bytes UTF-8 JSON ]

Op flow expected by the parent:

    1. Sidecar -> parent: {"op": "ready", "engine": "indextts2",
                           "sample_rate": 24000}
       (Model NOT yet loaded — that happens on the first synthesize op
       per Pitfall 8. The ready frame is just the handshake.)

    2. Optional: parent -> sidecar: {"op": "ping"} ->
                   sidecar -> parent: {"op": "pong"}

    3. Parent -> sidecar: {"op": "synthesize", "text": "...",
                            "ref_audio": "/path/to/spk.wav",
                            "emo_vector": [..], "emo_audio": "...",
                            "emo_text": "...", "emo_alpha": 1.0,
                            "use_random": false, "duration": 3.4}
       Sidecar emits one or more {"op": "progress",
                                  "stage": "loading_model",
                                  "percent": N} frames during the cold
       model construction, then:
                   sidecar -> parent: {"op": "audio",
                                       "audio_pcm_b64": "<base64 int16>",
                                       "sample_rate": 24000,
                                       "n_samples": N}

    4. Parent -> sidecar: {"op": "shutdown"} -> exit 0
    5. Unknown op -> {"op": "error", "stage": "dispatch",
                      "message": "unknown op: <op>"} and continue.

Restrictions:

  * NO imports from ``backend.services``, ``backend.engines`` (other
    than this package), or any Sesly parent code. The sidecar runs
    under a venv where those modules may not resolve.
  * NO logging of ``os.environ`` contents or env-var values. Defense in
    depth against accidental token-bytes-on-stderr (T-02-08); the
    parent's stderr drainer additionally pipes everything through the
    Phase 1 ``HFTokenRedactor`` filter.
  * Single-frame DoS cap matches the parent's ``MAX_FRAME_BYTES`` so a
    malformed inbound frame surfaces as a clean IOError instead of an
    OOM.
