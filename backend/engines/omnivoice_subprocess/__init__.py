"""omnivoice-subprocess: the resident OmniVoice TTS engine in a crash-isolated
sidecar process (#730/#1190).

The ``omnivoice`` engine runs in-process on CUDA, ROCm, and CPU. On MPS it is
resolved to :class:`OmniVoiceMPSSubprocessBackend` so a fatal native allocator
exit cannot take down the local API process.
When a generate or load there exceeds its execution budget the pool is "reset"
but the abandoned worker *thread* cannot be killed (Python cannot interrupt a
native torch/MPS call), so it holds the MPS device until it finishes on its
own, and every later synth contends with the zombie and hangs.

This engine runs the SAME OmniVoice model in a child process via
:class:`SubprocessBackend`. A child process CAN be hard-killed: on a recv
timeout the parent's watchdog calls ``proc.kill()``, reclaiming the child's
VRAM/device, and the next request transparently respawns a fresh sidecar. That
is the one thing the in-process engine structurally cannot do.

The explicit ``omnivoice-subprocess`` id remains available on every host for
operators who want the same containment elsewhere.

Tradeoff vs the in-process engine: identical model, controls, seed behavior,
and quality, with a little extra per-call overhead (one stdio round-trip).

Unlike IndexTTS / dots.tts / Supertonic-3, this sidecar runs under the PARENT
interpreter (``venv_python() -> sys.executable``): the goal here is crash
isolation, not dependency isolation, and the OmniVoice engine uses the host's
own pins.
