"""Minimal pipecat agent that speaks and listens through local Sesly.

Sesly defaults to a local OpenAI-compatible TTS/STT provider. For remote
use, point it only at a protected tailnet URL. See docs/agentic-voice.md.

Run Sesly first (default http://localhost:3900), then:

    uv pip install "pipecat-ai[openai,silero]"
    python examples/agentic/pipecat_minimal.py

This is a deliberately tiny skeleton: it wires the Sesly TTS/STT services
into a pipecat pipeline and leaves the transport + LLM for you to choose. It
does not run a phone call or a server — that is the "agentic v1" scope
(Sesly as provider, you bring the runtime).
