# ── Icon integrity ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# v0.4.2 shipped with .DirIcon as an ABSOLUTE symlink into the build machine:
#
#   .DirIcon -> /home/runner/work/Sesly/…/Sesly.AppDir/…
#
# That path exists on nobody's computer, so the link dangled the moment the
# AppImage left CI, and every tool that reads .DirIcon — file managers for the
# file's own icon, AppImageLauncher and appimaged for desktop integration — got
# nothing and drew a blank. A dangling symlink is not a build error, the bundle
# packs and runs fine, so nothing noticed for an entire release.
#
# `readlink -f` resolves the whole chain; the result has to stay inside the
# AppDir, because anything outside it does not travel with the bundle.
