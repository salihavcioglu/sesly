"""Crash-class recurrence report — the reliability cycle's definition of done.

The project's #1 lifetime failure class is "the backend died or never came
up" (~1 in 5 of every issue ever filed). This script measures whether that
class is actually shrinking, *filtered to reports from a given version* —
because 6 in 10 sampled reports historically came from builds that were
already obsolete when filed, and counting those as recurrence would judge
the work against noise it can't fix.

Reports are bucketed by the `**Build status:**` line the bug reporter stamps
into every body (fix/stale-build-report-deflection): `OUTDATED` vs `current
at filing time` vs absent (pre-deflection builds / freshness unknown).

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/crash_class_report.py            # since latest release
    uv run python scripts/crash_class_report.py --since 2026-08-13
    uv run python scripts/crash_class_report.py --version 0.5.0

Needs the `gh` CLI authenticated for salihavcioglu/sesly.
