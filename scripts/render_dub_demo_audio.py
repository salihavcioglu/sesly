"""Render the dubbing demo's five audio tracks with the Sesly engine.

`scripts/build_dub_demo.sh` builds the videos, subtitles and manifest, but it
got its audio from macOS `say` — so the demo could only be built on a Mac, and
on every other platform the Dub workspace's demo player pointed at files that
were never generated. The engine runs wherever the app does, which makes it the
portable answer, and it has the side benefit of the demo being rendered by the
thing it is demonstrating.

Writes `source.src.wav` + `dubbed_<code>.src.wav` next to where the videos will
be built; `build_dub_demo.sh` picks those up automatically and falls back to
`say` when they are absent.

Prerequisites are the same as scripts/render_demos_omnivoice.py: the project
venv and cached model weights.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/render_dub_demo_audio.py [--skip-existing]
