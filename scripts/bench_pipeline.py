"""Profile the hot paths of Sesly's major features — once, safely.

This exists because "make it faster" kept turning into guesswork. Every claim in
the dub-performance work (#1127, #1129) is supposed to come from a number, and a
number needs a repeatable way to get it.

**It is deliberately gentle with memory.** Sesly's worst bug class is the
out-of-memory kill on a 16 GB unified-memory Mac (#1119), so a profiler that
loads every model at once — or loops a benchmark until RAM runs out — would
reproduce the very crash it is meant to help fix. Therefore:

  * stages run **one at a time**, never concurrently;
  * every model is **unloaded between stages** (`free_vram()`), so peak RSS is
    one model, not the sum of them;
  * before each stage we check **actually-free RAM** and **skip the stage** if it
    is under the floor, rather than starting a load that the OS would kill;
  * each measurement is a small fixed number of passes — **no loops to
    convergence**, no "run until stable".

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/bench_pipeline.py              # everything
    uv run python scripts/bench_pipeline.py tts clone    # only these stages
    OMNIVOICE_BENCH_FLOOR_GB=4 uv run python scripts/bench_pipeline.py

Stop the backend first — it holds a TTS model and will skew every number.
