/**
 * nativeExit — naming the way a backend process died, from either shell.
 *
 * When the backend dies natively there is no Python traceback, only an exit
 * code. On Windows that code is an NTSTATUS, and the two desktop shells report
 * the same status differently:
 *
 *   Tauri    Rust `ExitStatus::code()` returns i32  ->  -1073741819
 *   Electron Node reports the raw DWORD             ->   3221225477
 *
 * Both are 0xC0000005, STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION. A table written against one
 * representation silently matches nothing from the other, which is how
 * https://github.com/salihavcioglu/sesly/issues/2250 arrived titled
 * "exit code 3221225477" with no indication that the backend had segfaulted.
 *
 * Signals diverge the same way: POSIX Tauri reports the number (11), Node
 * reports the name ('SIGSEGV').
 *
 * So nothing here picks a side. Every entry point normalises first, then
 * classifies — which is also what keeps a third producer (the backend's own
 * run-sentinel) from needing a fourth table.
