# Electron and Tauri behavior parity

This inventory tracks user-visible behavior. A row is **implemented** when Electron exposes the
same task and backend contract. Platform-specific performance may differ. A native row stays
**verification pending** until its real macOS, Windows, and Linux smoke gates pass.

Latest local verification (2026-09-14): the final unpacked Windows build launched against its
managed runtime and reported backend 0.5.2 healthy on an RTX 4090. Its responsive System Preflight
resolved the live CPU, GPU/VRAM, Python runtime, compute device, selected engines and storage paths.
OmniVoice was resident on CUDA,
all required setup models were ready, seven saved profiles loaded, and Parakeet TDT v3 was installed
and active for dictation. A saved 17-second clone reference also completed a live Parakeet
transcription in 0.66 seconds with the expected text. Focused model/runtime/profile/transcription coverage passed 41 renderer
checks plus 150 backend checks with `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` and an empty Hugging Face cache. The shared
secondary-sidebar smoke also passed every workspace from 640 to 1920 px.
The complete Electron component suite passes 462 checks across 119 files; first-run browser
acceptance additionally covers partial preflight recovery, recommended-model disclosure and the
compact Settings layout, while all 38 routes fit at 1440 and 640 px and 37 routes pass the DOM
accessibility audit at both widths.
The refreshed packaged backend also reported the resident `k2-fsa/OmniVoice` checkpoint with a
non-empty UTC load timestamp, `cuda:0` execution and 1937.2 MB allocated VRAM, closing the anonymous
ready-state gap across renderer refreshes.
The current production renderer additionally switched the live ASR backend out and back without
losing its selected model, completed a real Faster-Whisper upload through timed segments, export,
Clone handoff and cleanup, and round-tripped a generated take into a disposable saved profile.
Its live route sweep remained free of renderer warnings, exceptions and API failures after
updater, dictation, QR, locale loading, translation-file and local-agent discovery rejection paths
were contained at their initiating UI boundaries.
The inventory guard maps every current Tauri page, every static Electron route and every model
family to its maintained capability or responsive-layout evidence; adding an unmapped page or route
now fails the required test gate.
An isolated clean Ubuntu 26.04 workspace also completed the Electron typecheck and production
package, then passed the unpacked Linux artifact contract with its x64 app, bundled `uv`, branded
resources and native dictation helper present.

The inventory records behavior and verification only. It does not reopen layouts or mechanics that
already satisfy their task. New parity work should update the relevant row and add the narrowest
regression evidence that proves it.

Electron also consumes the backend's `/ws/events` invalidation stream for profiles, generation and
dub history, projects, exports and model state. Local development waits for backend health before
opening the proxied socket; packaged and authenticated remote connections use the main-owned,
path-bound WebSocket URL and reconnect without exposing credentials.

`bun run smoke:live-routes` from `electron/` exercises all 37 concrete route views through the
running hash router and real backend. It fails on an error boundary, missing heading, uncaught
exception, console error or warning, failed load or HTTP error response. The 2026-09-13 live run passed every
route with no failures.

## Settings navigation

Studio is the default palette for both Light and Dark on a fresh install. Selecting a palette under either appearance applies it immediately and saves it for later switches, including System mode changes. Existing saved palette choices remain unchanged.

The main workspace sidebar stays visible on Settings routes, including while the backend is starting or unavailable. Settings keeps its own section list beside it, with a Settings heading instead of a duplicate brand header. Narrow windows use the same compact-rail behavior as other secondary-pane workspaces.

## Navigation order

In the expanded sidebar, workspace navigation sits immediately below the header and above the voice library. The status bar and Settings entry remain at the bottom; voice-library scrolling does not move the navigation.

In the compact rail, Voice, Stories and Dubbing open flyouts on mouse hover or click, with full-row click targets. Hover uses a short opening delay and a pointer transit delay into the flyout; touch users can click, and keyboard users can press Enter or Arrow Right/Down to open it, then Arrow Left or Escape to return to the trigger. Choosing a destination keeps its flyout mounted until the route changes; choosing the current destination closes it immediately. Outside clicks close flyouts. Double-clicking the compact rail expands the full sidebar; the header button remains the single-click control. The flyout appears beside its icon without a scale shift while the pointer moves into it.

## Sidebar expansion preference

Settings → Appearance → Keep sidebar expanded persists the choice locally. It disables automatic compaction on narrower secondary-pane workspaces; the default remains automatic. The explicit close control still works, and the Profiles workspace still avoids duplicating its voice library. The header toggle and sidebar share one state. A compact rail can reopen itself on every desktop platform, using the brand icon on Windows/Linux.
