# Profile portraits and saving

The Electron cloning workspace shows a name-and-portrait form immediately after
an audio upload or recording. Saving selects the new profile; **Use without
saving** proceeds with the temporary reference. **Change voice** opens the saved
voice chooser without discarding the script.

Saved voices use compact selectable rows, with separate preview/delete controls.
The script editor fills the available workspace; generation controls and the
compact latest-take player stay anchored at the bottom. Preserve this established
layout when polishing visuals rather than moving the primary action. The reference pane includes saved-reference playback.
Language search measures its virtual list after the popover mounts.
Latest take spans the full content pane. Closing it stops its playback and clears
the current player without deleting the saved take from history.

Initials are generated locally from the first and last words of the profile name.
Optional JPEG, PNG and WebP uploads are limited to 5 MB and 16 megapixels,
cropped to 256 × 256, and re-encoded without source metadata. Portraits live next
to profile audio as `<id>.portrait.jpg`; deleting a profile removes its portrait.
The reference pane and saved-profile editor allow replacing a portrait through either upload or the same explicit five-result image search used while creating a profile.

After a new clone profile is saved, Electron releases the temporary upload and
switches the composer to the returned profile as one atomic state change. The
returned language, style and server-generated local-ASR transcript become the
composer metadata, so deleting or changing that profile cannot revive a stale
reference file from before the save.

`POST /profiles` accepts an optional `image` multipart field and returns the full
profile, including `image_url`. `PUT /profiles/{id}/image` replaces the portrait;
`GET /profiles/{id}/image` serves it. No database migration is required.

## Optional image search

Search runs only when the user clicks **Search images**. It sends the entered
name to the ordinary Google Images search page. No API key is required.
The search requests SafeSearch and Google's JPEG file-type filter, then returns
up to five valid thumbnails. Thumbnails are decoded, normalized and saved locally
through the same profile-image flow as uploads; remote originals are never fetched.

Only Google's HTTPS thumbnail proxy hosts and embedded JPEG previews are accepted from that page.
If Google requires browser JavaScript, consent, or a CAPTCHA, Sesly falls back to Openverse's
public search with mature content excluded and reuse-friendly licensing filters. It never bypasses
Google challenges. Initials and file uploads remain available if neither source responds.
Filtering does not guarantee that every result is appropriate or licensed for reuse.

Live verification: `node electron/tests/profile-image-search-real-smoke.mjs` creates a disposable
local profile, opens its Electron editor, requests the explicit no-key search, verifies five
selectable portraits, persists one through the real image endpoint, verifies the normalized JPEG
and refreshed avatar, then removes the profile.

## Recoverable generation failures

Generation failures appear once in the composer, with technical details collapsed.
The script is preserved for retry. Shared audio writers recreate missing parent
directories before writing, including folders removed after backend startup.

Playback belongs to the latest-take player. Synthesize always starts generation;
playing a take never replaces that button with a playback control.

The synthesis button reserves fixed space for its label and cancellation control.
Elapsed time uses tabular digits below the button. During an active request,
`/model/status` supplies the localized runtime sub-stage and model-load percentage;
response-body progress takes over when audio delivery begins.

The voice selector labels the active voice explicitly. Voice sample opens its
reference pane, and an empty script prompts with the selected voice name.
Paste and Insert remain secondary actions; Insert explains expression tokens
in its accessible label and tooltip. These refinements preserve the anchored layout.

## Reference transcription and editing

The save-profile view uses the editor's full content width. New uploaded or
recorded references use the selected local dictation pipeline (including its
configured Parakeet/Whisper fallback). Installed-model readiness is checked before
transcription; no model downloads are initiated. Missing models leave manual
transcript entry available. ASR never overwrites text edited while it runs.
Saving waits for transcription; using the reference without saving remains possible.

Saved-voice pencil buttons, and **Edit voice** on the selected voice in the
voice-sample pane, open a profile editor for name, transcript, style, portrait
and reference sample. Clicking a saved voice still only selects it; editing does
not select a different voice. The voice-sample pane's chevron collapses it; the
Voice sample toolbar control reopens it.

The editor plays the stored reference. For clone voices, **Replace reference**
accepts an upload or recording with the same format and length checks as a new
voice. **Keep current reference** discards the new clip. **Save** writes it
to the same profile. The profile id, name, portrait, style, language and history
stay the same. The transcript field clears when a new clip is chosen; leave it
blank to transcribe the new clip locally. Replacing the reference also clears
the voice's locked take and own-voice verification, because the new clip may be
a different speaker. Designed voices are edited through their recipe instead.

`PUT /profiles/{id}/audio` (multipart `ref_audio`, optional `ref_text`, `name`,
`instruct`, `language` and `personality`) stores the clip under a new
`<id>-<token>.<ext>` filename and saves the other fields in the same database
update, so an editor save commits every change or none. The old files are
deleted only after the database update succeeds. The new filename also
invalidates engine prompt caches and audiobook chapter caches, because those are
keyed by the reference path. Profile records include a versioned `audio_url` so
players reload the new clip, and `GET /profiles/{id}/audio` serves each clip with
its own media type. The route accepts WAV, MP3, M4A, FLAC, OGG, Opus, AAC and
WebM up to 128 MiB, and requires libsndfile or FFmpeg to decode real samples
before the clip replaces the old one; a file neither can decode returns 422.
Replacements of one voice run one at a time, and a clip changed by another
writer during an upload returns 409. Designed voices return 409. A Gallery or
Community voice whose reference is replaced counts as the user's own edit: importing the same voice again creates a separate profile
and leaves the edited one unchanged. No database migration is required.

The sidebar lists selected TTS, ASR and LLM engines, resolved model identities
where available, and the selected installed dictation model. These are selections,
not a claim that model weights are currently loaded.

Engine change controls open Settings / Models with separate TTS, ASR, dictation,
and LLM pages. Lists scroll independently of the settings sidebar; unavailable
engines and undownloaded dictation models cannot be selected. Engine selection
uses the shared backend preferences and refreshes sidebar metadata.

Script import supports TXT, Markdown, DOC, DOCX, PDF and EPUB (text documents,
not scanned-image OCR). Paste inserts at the caret; Replace script offers Undo.
Clicking in the script shows the expression picker near the caret without taking
typing focus. The voice chooser and save-profile form share the editor width.
