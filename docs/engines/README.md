# Engine guides

One page per engine: what it's for, what it needs, how to enable it, and its
quirks. Select engines in **Model Catalogue** (or quick-switch with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>), or pin one with
`OMNIVOICE_TTS_BACKEND` / `OMNIVOICE_ASR_BACKEND`.

When an engine reports itself unavailable, expand its row's **Why?** panel and
use **Learn more** to jump straight to that engine's page here. The row's own
message stays deliberately generic — an availability probe can carry local
paths or credentials, so it is never shown verbatim — and the page below is
where the actual requirements and setup steps live.

The compute device (CUDA/ROCm/MPS/CPU) is auto-detected; pin it under
**Settings → Performance & Device** (or `OMNIVOICE_DEVICE`) if auto-detect
picks wrong — see [performance](../performance.md).

Measured speed/VRAM numbers live in [benchmarks](../benchmarks.md); what each
engine can do expressively in [expressive-speech](../expressive-speech.md);
sidecar disk footprints in [disk-usage](disk-usage.md); the bar a new engine
must clear in [engine-acceptance](../engine-acceptance.md).

New to Sesly? Install the app first — [macOS](../install/macos.md)
(first launch needs the one-time right-click → **Open** Gatekeeper
approval), [Windows](../install/windows.md), [Linux](../install/linux.md),
[Docker](../install/docker.md).

### Reference clip length

Voice Clone accepts clips up to 75 seconds and recommends 5–15 seconds of clean
speech. How much of a longer clip reaches the model depends on the engine; the
Voice Clone screen says which applies, and `GET /engines` reports it per engine
as `max_ref_seconds` and `ref_strategy`.

| Engine | Uses | From a longer clip |
|---|---|---|
| Sesly (OmniVoice), OmniVoice (subprocess) | up to 20 s | picks the 15 s passage with the most speech and transcribes it (`best_window`) |
| VoxCPM2 | up to 30 s | keeps the first 30 s after edge-silence trim (`head`) |
| Other engines | not verified | the clip is passed through (`null`) |

A whole-clip transcript cannot match a passage the engine cuts out, so automatic
and saved transcripts are ignored when the clip is over the limit. A transcript
sent with a `/generate` request for an OmniVoice clip longer than 20 s, whether
an upload or a saved voice, is rejected with `[clone_ref_too_long]`: trim both
to the same passage, or leave the transcript out. The limits are the same when
an engine runs in its own environment.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| WhisperX | [whisperx](whisperx.md) | CUDA · CPU | dubbing (word timestamps + diarization) | installed by default |

| Moonshine | [moonshine](moonshine.md) | CPU | edge/low-power, no timestamps | `pip install` (see guide) |
| FunASR (SenseVoice) | [funasr](funasr.md) | CUDA · CPU | 50+ languages, inline diarization | `pip install funasr` |
| Sherpa-ONNX dictation | [sherpa-onnx-asr](sherpa-onnx-asr.md) | CPU | live streaming dictation | curated model download |
| OpenAI-compatible (local or remote) | [openai-compatible-asr](openai-compatible-asr.md) | network | a configured endpoint; loopback stays local | Model Catalogue |

Speaker diarization is not an engine registry of its own — the dub pipeline
uses pyannote (HF-gated; see [diarization](../features/diarization.md)) and
FunASR can diarize inline with its `cam++` speaker model.
