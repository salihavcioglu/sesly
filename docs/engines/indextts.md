# Sesly — IndexTTS 2.5

IndexTTS 2.5 is an optional, multilingual voice-cloning engine for dubbing
and expressive speech. It supports Chinese, English, Japanese, Spanish, and
Arabic, with reference-audio cloning, emotion references, emotion vectors,
and text-directed emotion.

Sesly runs IndexTTS in a dedicated subprocess and Python environment.
This keeps its `transformers<5` dependency isolated from Sesly's
runtime. Existing user-managed IndexTTS-2 environments remain supported.

## Install

IndexTTS 2.5 is not bundled because its source environment and model weights
require substantial disk space.

1. Open **Model Catalogue**.
2. Expand **IndexTTS 2.5** and select **Install**.
3. Keep Sesly open while source, dependencies, and weights download.

The installer:

- checks for `uv` and at least 12 GB of free space;
- installs the reviewed `indextts-2.5` source revision in an isolated Python 3.11 venv;
- downloads the reviewed `IndexTeam/IndexTTS-2.5` model revision;
- resumes partial model downloads;
- saves `OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR` and activates the engine without a restart.

An app-managed IndexTTS-2 checkout remains intact while 2.5 installs into a
separate directory. Sesly switches to 2.5 only after the new source,
environment, and weights pass verification. User-managed clones are never
modified or removed; their legacy
`indextts.infer_v2` entry point remains supported.

Retrying a partial install rebuilds an incompatible managed Python environment
(such as Python 3.14), preserving source and downloaded weights. Existing
Python 3.10/3.11 environments are reused. Linked environments are never removed;
if their interpreter cannot be checked, the installer reports how to recover.

## Manual install

Use a separate checkout and venv. Do not install IndexTTS into Sesly's
root environment.

```bash
git clone --branch indextts-2.5 https://github.com/index-tts/index-tts.git
cd index-tts
uv venv .venv --python 3.11
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e .
hf download IndexTeam/IndexTTS-2.5 --local-dir=checkpoints
```

On Windows, replace `.venv/bin/python` with `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`.
Then set `OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR` to the checkout root:

```bash
export OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR=/path/to/index-tts
```

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
  "OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR",
  "$env:USERPROFILE\code\index-tts",
  "User"
)
```

Restart Sesly after setting a persistent environment variable outside
the app.

## Compatibility

Sesly probes these locations in order:

1. `${OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR}/.venv/`;
2. `backend/engines/indextts/.venv/`;
3. a venv bootstrapped from `OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR`.

The probe prefers `indextts.infer_v2_5` and falls back to
`indextts.infer_v2`. A timed-out import is treated as unproven rather than
missing, preventing slow disks or antivirus scans from hiding a valid venv.
Set `OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_IMPORT_PROBE_TIMEOUT_S` to raise the default 60-second
probe limit.

### Long-text generation

A long passage can keep `infer()` busy for several minutes. The sidecar emits a
keep-alive frame every 5 seconds while it works, so the parent can tell a slow
synthesis from a wedged one, and waits up to 900 seconds for a sidecar that has
gone genuinely silent. Set `OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_RECV_TIMEOUT_S` (minimum 30) to
tune that ceiling.

IndexTTS 2.5 requires a language token. Sesly maps locale codes and
language names to the five supported languages and detects Chinese, Japanese,
or Arabic script for Auto requests. Ambiguous Latin text defaults to English.

IndexTTS 2.5 uses `duration_factor` for native duration guidance. Sesly's
dubbing fit stage remains responsible for exact segment timing. Legacy
IndexTTS-2 installations continue receiving their `target_tokens` control.

## Troubleshooting

### Engine unavailable

Use **Model Catalogue → IndexTTS 2.5 → Install**. For a manual install,
confirm that the configured directory contains:

```text
pyproject.toml
indextts/infer_v2_5.py
checkpoints/config.yaml
```

`IndexTeam/IndexTTS-2.5` ships the model config as `config.yaml`. Earlier
installs only worked after hand-renaming it to `config_v2_5.yaml`; both names
are accepted, so a renamed checkout keeps working as-is and needs no
reinstall.

### Missing checkpoint under a foreign absolute path

Some pinned configs name checkpoints on the upstream authors' training cluster.
When a configured absolute `gpt_checkpoint` or `s2mel_checkpoint` is missing,
Sesly uses the installed `gpt.pth` or `s2mel.pth` if present. This also
handles Windows paths on other operating systems. Existing valid custom paths
and relative paths remain unchanged.

The adjustment exists only in a temporary config while loading the model;
your downloaded config and weights are never rewritten. No reinstall or
additional download is needed. If the local fallback is also missing, the
original loading error is preserved rather than substituting another model.

### `uv` not found

The desktop app ships `uv` and points the backend at it through
`OMNIVOICE_BUNDLED_UV`, so an installed build needs nothing from you. Before
v0.5.5 the shell located that binary but never passed it on, and because the
packaged `uv` sits in the app's own resources directory — on nobody's `PATH`,
and a GUI launch inherits no shell `PATH` additions either — preflight reported
it missing while the binary was right there
([#2215](https://github.com/salihavcioglu/sesly/issues/2215)).

Running from source, install `uv` from <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>, or set
`OMNIVOICE_BUNDLED_UV` to the absolute path of a `uv` binary to pin one
explicitly — an explicit value always wins over the bundled copy.

### Import fails after installation

For an app-managed install, retry **Install** to repair the source and venv.
For a manual install, run:

```bash
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e .
```

### Insufficient disk space

Free the amount reported by the installer, then retry. Completed model files
are reused.

## License

IndexTTS 2.5 uses the bilibili Model Use License. It grants a limited,
worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license subject to its restrictions.
A separate license is required when the user or an affiliate exceeded 100
million monthly active users in the preceding month or RMB 1 billion in annual
revenue in the preceding year. The agreement also includes downstream,
derivative-work, prohibited-use, attribution, and compliance obligations.
Review the [official license](https://huggingface.co/IndexTeam/IndexTTS-2.5/blob/main/LICENSE)
before installing or using the model.

This model is not covered by Sesly's blanket commercial-use statement.
Organizations above either threshold must obtain Bilibili's separate written
license before installing or using IndexTTS 2.5. Other engines remain available
without enabling this optional sidecar.
