"""Cross-layer contract lock for the admin-gate 403 detail string.

The backend's ``require_admin``/``require_admin_action`` answer 403 with a
mode-distinct ``detail`` (``_admin_gate_403`` in backend/api/dependencies.py):
"loopback origin or admin API key required" in server mode, plain
"loopback origin required" on the desktop build. The SPA's ``apiFetch`` routes
a 403 to the API-key login gate exactly when the detail contains the substring
"admin api key" (frontend/src/api/client.ts) — i.e. when presenting the key
could actually satisfy the gate. The per-mode behaviour is pinned by
tests/test_loopback_server_mode.py; this file pins the LITERAL contract across
layers: a backend reword keeps backend tests green while the frontend matcher
silently stops firing, and a LAN user is back to raw 403 spam instead of the
login form.
