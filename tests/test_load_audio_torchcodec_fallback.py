"""``load_audio`` must survive torchaudio 2.9 without TorchCodec (#1931).

torchaudio >= 2.9 routes ``load()`` through TorchCodec, which needs FFmpeg
*shared libraries* on the system. Where those are absent the call raises
``ImportError`` — but ``load_audio`` caught only ``(RuntimeError, OSError)``,
so the pydub fallback written for precisely this situation never ran. Every
voice-clone reference read, watermark check and dub segment load then failed
with "TorchCodec is required for load_with_torchcodec".

This is the read-side twin of the ``_safe_torchaudio_save`` regression in
``tests/backend/services/test_audio_io.py``, and it reaches the same users:
#1931 guarded ``set_audio_backend()`` against torchaudio 2.9 but left
``load()`` unprotected. arm64 CUDA hosts reach it unavoidably, since torch
2.8.0 publishes no aarch64 wheel.

Note that ``backend="soundfile"`` does not avoid this — torchaudio 2.9
accepts that argument and ignores it.
