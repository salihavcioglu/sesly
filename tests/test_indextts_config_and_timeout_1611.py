"""IndexTTS 2.5 install + long-text synthesis (#1611).

Two independent defects, both reported against a working upstream install:

1. **Install always failed.** ``IndexTeam/IndexTTS-2.5`` ships ``config.yaml``
   — at the pinned revision and at HEAD; ``config_v2_5.yaml`` exists in no
   upstream revision. Sesly demanded that name, so ``_weights_floor_ok``
   never found it and the install died claiming "the download was likely
   interrupted" when the download had been perfect. The only way through was
   to hand-rename the file, which is what the reporter did.

2. **Long text was killed at 60s.** ``infer()`` is one blocking upstream call
   that says nothing on the wire, and IndexTTS was the only sidecar still on
   the 60s ``recv_timeout_s`` class default. Raising that default alone does
   NOT fix it (the reporter tried 3600): frames are also what report activity
   to the GPU pool's execution clock, so a silent sidecar still trips the
   outer generate budget. The sidecar has to heartbeat.

Installs created with the hand-renamed config must keep working untouched —
existing-engine compatibility is a hard rule.
