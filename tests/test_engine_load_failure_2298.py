"""A weight download that FAILS must not surface as "internal error" (#2298).

Field report (#2298): KittenTTS on Windows, first generate, HTTP 500 —
"Sesly hit an internal error; check the backend log for details."
The reporter had a Hugging Face mirror configured and it was unreachable, so
the engine's lazy first-use weight fetch raised a connectivity error.

`/generate` already warms the adapter under the model-LOAD budget before the
generate clock starts (#1033), precisely because a cold engine downloads its
weights inside `generate()`. But that warm-up only translated
``TimeoutError``/``ModelLoadTimeout`` into an actionable 503. Every other
load failure — the download refused, DNS gone, the mirror down, the file
truncated, the cache corrupt — escaped the route uncaught and was rendered by
the global 500 handler as "Sesly hit an internal error", which names
neither the engine nor the fact that a model download was what failed.

So the two halves of the same event disagreed: a download that STALLS is
explained, a download that FAILS is an internal error. These tests hold both
halves to the same standard, on both routes that warm an adapter.

Engine-stub pattern from tests/test_load_budget_split_1033.py.
