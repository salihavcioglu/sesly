"""The committed protocol stubs must match the .proto they came from.

The stubs are committed so that neither the installer, the frozen build, nor
Docker needs ``protoc``. The cost of that convenience is drift: someone edits
``worker_v1.proto``, forgets to regenerate, and the mismatch surfaces later as
a baffling attribute error at runtime — or worse, as a field that silently
never arrives. Regenerating into a temporary directory and diffing turns that
into a red test with an obvious fix.
