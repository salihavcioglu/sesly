"""Regression guard for the bundled model catalog (``backend/config/models.yaml``).

Issue #239: two ASR entries pointed at Hugging Face repo IDs that returned
HTTP 404 ("Repository Not Found"), so users could not install those ASR models:

* ``UsefulSensors/moonshine-small`` — no such model (Moonshine ships *tiny* /
  *base*, there is no 300M "small").
* ``Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo`` — Systran publishes no turbo repo.

These tests are intentionally **static** (no network) so they run in CI: they
assert every ``repo_id`` is well-formed and that the known-bad IDs can never be
reintroduced. They do not verify live HF availability — that would be flaky and
slow — but they stop the catalog from shipping the exact IDs that broke #239.
