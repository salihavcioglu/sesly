"""Bucketing contract for scripts/crash_class_report.py — the reliability
cycle's recurrence metric.

Pins two things:
- title → sub-class mapping matches the auto-reporter's real title shapes
  (seeded from error messages, so titles are machine-stable), and
- body → build bucket mapping matches the exact `**Build status:**` lines
  the bug reporter stamps (frontend/src/utils/bugReport.js) — a drift in
  either side silently zeroes the metric.
