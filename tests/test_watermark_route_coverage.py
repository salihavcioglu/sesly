"""Structural guard: no synthesis call site can ship without provenance marking.

The #1169 class: watermark coverage grew call-site-by-call-site (three
separate ``embed_watermark`` calls) until a fourth producer —
``/v1/audio/speech`` — shipped synthetic audio with no mark at all, with EU AI
Act Art. 50(2) applying from 2026-08-02. The fix is ONE chokepoint,
``services.watermark.mark_synthetic``; this guard makes the chokepoint
structurally load-bearing:

1. Every backend module that invokes a TTS synthesis primitive must reference
   ``mark_synthetic`` — or sit in the justified allowlist below. A future
   audio route that synthesizes without marking fails here before it ships.
2. Known producers must KEEP their ``mark_synthetic`` call (deleting one fails).
3. ``embed_watermark`` may not be called outside ``services/watermark.py`` —
   new code physically can't bypass the chokepoint's logging/uniformity.
4. Allowlist entries must still match the synthesis pattern (no stale
   exemptions accumulating).

Behavioral (detect-on-response) coverage per route lives in
tests/test_synthetic_audio_watermark_1169.py.

    """``src`` with comments and string literals blanked to spaces.

    ee35d238 made a module a "producer" by *mentioning* ``backend.generate()``
    in a comment — prose can't synthesize audio. Only real call sites may
    match ``_SYNTH_CALL``, so blank every COMMENT/STRING token span (spaces,
    not deletion, to keep the layout the regexes were written against).
    Unparseable source falls back to the raw text — fail closed, a module we
    can't tokenize still gets scanned.

    f-strings stay conservative (review, #1564): on Python ≤3.11 the
    whole f-string — replacement expressions included — is ONE STRING token,
    so blanking it would let ``f"{backend.generate(t)}"`` evade the guard.
    f-prefixed strings are therefore kept raw there (a literal f-string
    *mentioning* a primitive false-positives toward the allowlist — fail
    closed). On 3.12+ (PEP 701) replacement code arrives as ordinary tokens
    and only the literal FSTRING_MIDDLE text is blanked.
