"""Every demo asset the UI advertises actually ships.

This exists because they did not. `personalities.py` has carried a
``preview_url`` for each of the seven voice-design presets since they were
added, and the WAVs behind them were never committed — the demo tooling that
renders them (``scripts/build_demos.sh``) hard-requires macOS ``say``, so on any
other machine the files simply never appeared. Result: seven preview buttons in
the voice picker that returned 404, plus three dictation replay clips and the
whole dubbing demo in the same state.

Nothing caught it, because a missing static file is not an import error and not
a failing request in any test — the app just plays nothing. So the check is
mechanical and lives here: every path the code hands to the browser is resolved
against the directory ``main.py`` actually mounts.

If this fails after adding a preset, render the assets rather than deleting the
check:

    python3 scripts/render_demos_omnivoice.py     # voice design + dictation
    python3 scripts/render_dub_demo_audio.py      # dubbing audio
    bash scripts/build_dub_demo.sh                # dubbing videos + manifest
