"""Seeding a Dub job from the caption track downloaded with a video.

When a video has no manual captions in its language, ingest downloads the
platform's automatic ``-orig`` track. On YouTube that track *rolls*: every cue
repeats the line before it, a 10 ms cue holding only that line joins the two,
and each cue starts exactly where the previous one ended. The seeded
transcript must still read every spoken line once.
