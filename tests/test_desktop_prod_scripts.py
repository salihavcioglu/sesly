"""`desktop-prod:run` must not destroy the developer's data (#1333).

`scripts/desktop-prod.sh` exists to emulate a first install, so wiping is its
default: it removes the app data dir, the backend data dir (``~/.omnivoice`` —
the SQLite database, every voice profile, and all outputs), the Tauri logs and
the WebKit profile. `--keep-data` is the only thing that suppresses that.

`--skip-build` is an INDEPENDENT flag that only skips the cargo compile. The
package script advertised as a re-launch — its own header calls it "re-launch
last build (skip compile)" — passed `--skip-build` alone, so every "just run it
again" silently deleted the user's voice profiles and project database. That is
the gap this test closes: the wipe stays opt-out, but the *re-launch* aliases
have to opt out of it.

Mechanical on purpose: a rule a reviewer would have
to remember belongs in a test, not in anyone's head.
